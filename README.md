MailChimp Export API PHP Library v1.0.2
===========================

This software package is a free, open-source library, or &ldquo;wrapper,&rdquo;
for the PHP programming language, which provides support for the MailChimp
Export API v1.0. The library handles all of the details of the actual network
connections, parameters, and interface to MailChimp's Export API service.
Utilizing the library allows developers to focus on using the data objects
exposed by the API service&mdash;without having to spend time learning how to
connect to and use it&mdash;when integrating a PHP application or script
with MailChimp.

Feature Support
---------------

The library currently supports the member list and campaign subscriber activity
data export functionality of the MailChimp Export API v1.0 corresponding to the
MailChimp v7.9 release (see this release&rsquo;s
[API documentation](http://web.archive.org/web/20130124182745/http://apidocs.mailchimp.com/export/1.0/)
archived by [Internet Archve](http://archive.org)).
It does not yet support changes introduced to the MailChimp Export API v1.0
corresponding to MailChimp v8.0 or later releases.
